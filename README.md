Making 4 different c files wcap, wgrep, wzip, wunzip

wcap takes in files from argv and prints them out to the screen
wgrep takes in files from argv and the string you're trying to search for in the files and prints the line if the string is found in the file.
wzip takes in files from argv and compresses the file
wunzip takes in files from argv and uncompresses the file in binary
